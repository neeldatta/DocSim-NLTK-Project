In this tutorial we will cover many of the Sumerian basics. The end result will be a furnished room with a light switch. A user can click on the Light switch to make it flip up and down and to turn on/off a light. Note: This tutorial uses HTML3D is not currently supported in Virtual Reality. Therefore, the results of this exercise will not be fully supported in VR. In this exercise, we will learn and accomplish the following:\n\nCreate a room with primitive entities (Box)\nCover lighting basics\nImport entities from the asset library\nPlace and move objects\nCreate interactive behaviors using the State Machine\nAdd basic animations\n\n\nThis is the scene we will build in this tutorial (Note: Using Sumerian Hosts will not be covered in this exercise). Be sure you are using the latest version of your browser.\nPrerequisites\nBefore you begin, you should have completed the following tasks and tutorials:\n\nSign in to Amazon Sumerian with your AWS account\nComplete the Introduction to the Amazon Sumerian Interface tutorial.\n\nGetting Started: Creating a New Scene\nFrom the AWS console, find Amazon Sumerian or go directly to the Dashboard. From the dashboard, create a new Empty scene.\n\nStep 1: Add a Box and Lights\nIn this step, we will add a simple Box and 3 lights (Point, Directional, Spot). We will then move and reposition the Light entities.\n\n\nClick Create Entity above the canvas, and select a Box to add to your scene.\n\n\n\nNext, we will add 3 lights by clicking Create Entity. Under the Lights category let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s start by adding a Point light.\n\n\nThe Transform component defines an entity\u00e2\u0080\u0099s position in 3D space. We want to adjust the Transform values so they are above and shining down on the box. You can change Transform values by clicking and dragging the handles attached to the entity (i.e. colored arrows) or by manually changing the numerical values in the component.\n\n\n\nRepeat this process for the Directional and Spot lights.\n\n\nRename the Light entities by selecting each Light in the Entities panel, and then selecting the top component in the Inspector panel on the right. You will see a Name text box.\n\n\n\nRename each light according to it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s light type: Point, Directional, and Spot.\n\nNote: The Lights\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Transform values will not affect the outcome of this exercise. Move them to wherever you like.\nWe will position our lights with the following Transform values:\nPoint:\n\nDirectional:\n\nSpot:\n\nNote on Lights: For Directional lights, Translation values (that is the positional coordinates within our scene) do not affect how a light is cast onto objects within a scene, while Rotation values do affect the light cast. Conversely, for the Point light, Rotation values do not affect the light cast while Translation values do affect the light cast. The Spot light is affected by both Rotation and Translation.\n\n\nTo change the Rotation of the Directional and Spot lights, change or the Rotation values in the Transform component, or click the Rotation handles button. This will provide your entities with rings that you can then click and drag to change the rotation. Rotate your lights so they are pointing at the Box.\n\n\n\nFinally, we want to group all three of our Light entities into a single parent entity. From the Create Entity menu, add an Empty entity.\n\n\n\nRename the empty entity to \u00e2\u0080\u009cLights\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nIn the Entities, panel drag and drop each light entity onto your new empty Lights entity (this will group all three light entities as children of the parent Lights entity).\n\n\n\nStep 2: Creating a Room Using a Primitive Box\nIn this step, we will create a room by using a Box. We will change the Transform values and changing the Culling so we will only see the inside of the Box (by only rendering the inner faces of the Box).\n\n\nCreate a Box entity and rename it \u00e2\u0080\u009cRoom\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nWith the Room entity selected, expand the Material component and then open the Culling property.\n\n\nChange the Cull Face drop down option to Front.\n\nNote: This makes it so we will only see the inside of the Box by only rendering the inner faces of the Room.\n\n\nChange the Transform values to the following. Note: We do recommend making your Room Transform values identical to ours!\n\n\n\nOptional: Change the color of the room by expanding the Material component, and then open the Color (Diffuse) property. Change the color using the color picker. We will choose a pink color.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Importing Objects (furniture)\nIn this step, we will import several objects to furnish our room. We will add a chair, table, rug, and lamp. Feel free to import any objects you like.\n\n\nClick Import Assets above the canvas. This will open the asset library.\n\n\n\nScroll down to find the furniture assets. We will select and add a chair.\n\n\n\nOnce the object/asset populates in the Asset Panel expand the asset pack contents and find the entity asset type, which has a hexagon icon next to it. Drag the entity onto the canvas.\n\n\n\nRename your entity to \u00e2\u0080\u009cChair\u00e2\u0080\u009d.  Note: You can rename the entity \u00e2\u0080\u009cChair\u00e2\u0080\u009d either from the Asset Panel or the Entities panel.\n\n\nPosition your Chair somewhere in your room by changing the Transform values.\n\n\n\nTo practice adding more objects to your scene, try adding the following:\n\nTable\nLamp\nRug\n\nYour scene should look something like this:\n\nStep 4: Customizing Textures\nIn this step, we will place a custom picture on the wall by using a Quad entity and then adding a custom image as the texture.\n\n\nFrom the Create Entity menu, add a Quad.\n\n\n\nRename the Quad \u00e2\u0080\u009cPicture\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nPosition the Picture somewhere on the wall and adjust the Scale values to be (1, 1.5. 1).\n\n\n\nWith the Picture entity selected, expand the Material component and then expand the Color (Diffuse) property. Either upload your own image or drag and drop your own image on the texture drop input. We will use a picture taken in Seattle.\n\n\n\nOur scene will look something like the following:\n\nStep 5: Adding a Light Switch\nIn this step, we will add the Light switch.\n\n\nOpen the asset library. Search for and add the Light switch asset.\n\n\n\nLike you did with the furniture entities, from the Assets panel, add the Light Switch entity to your scene.\n\n\nThe light switch will appear in your scene but it will probably be too small to see. Change the Scale of the light switch to (7, 7, 7). Move the Light switch to be somewhere on the wall:\n\n\n\nLastly, we want to move the switch to be in the down position (not sticking straight out like it is currently). In the Entities panel, expand the light switch entity until you can see the light_switch child entity. Select it.\n\n\n\nAdjust the Z Rotation of the light_switch entity to 23.\n\n\n\nAdjust Your Lights\nIn this step, we will move the Point light to sit inside the lightbulb of the Lamp entity.\n\n\nUse the Translation handles to move your Point light to be inside the Lamp.\n\n\n\nNow that we have everything in our scene, we can adjust the lights. Rotate the Directional and Spot lights to a position of your liking.\n\n\n\nStep 6: State Machine Behaviors\nA State Machine is the system to build behaviors, which are changes to entities initiated by a user. Behaviors can act alone or they can act in a sequence. They can\nbe movements, animations, sounds, camera changes, collisions, reactions, AWS service integrations, etc. Behaviors are built using a collection of States that are connected by Transitions, as an entity transitions from one state to another.\nIn this step, we will create 2 behaviors that will each serve a different purpose. The Switch On/Off behavior will allow a user to click the light switch so that it flips up and down (technically, it will be rotating). This behavior will also emit a message that can be used by our second behavior (Light On/Off) to initiate, thus turning the lights on and off.\nSwitch On/Off Behavior\nThis behavior will be attached to the light_switch object inside the Light switch entity (i.e. the switch of the light switch).\n\n\nSelect the light_switch entity, nested under the light switch.\n\n\nIn the Inspector panel, click Add Component and add a State Machine component.\n\n\n\nClick the + button to add a new behavior. This will open the State Machine editor.\n\n\nRename the behavior \u00e2\u0080\u009cSwitch On/Off Behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nWith the default, and only, State 1 selected, change the name of the state to \u00e2\u0080\u009cWait for Click\u00e2\u0080\u009d and then click Add Action.\n\n\n\nThis will open the action library. Search for and add the Click/Tap on entity action.\n\n\n\nAdd a new state.\n\n\n\nChange the name to \u00e2\u0080\u009cFlip Up\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nAdd another action. Search for and add the Tween Rotate action.\n\n\nAdjust the action\u00e2\u0080\u0099s properties to the following:\n\n\n\nAdd another state. Rename the new state \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmit On\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\nAdd another action. Search for and add the Emit Message action.\n\n\nIn the Channel message, type \u00e2\u0080\u009clightOn\u00e2\u0080\u009d (this is case sensitive!).\n\n\nAdd another action. Search for and add the Transition action.\n\n\n\nSelect the Wait for Click state and duplicate it.\n\n\n\nReposition the states node and then duplicate the Flip Up state. Rename to Flip Down. Change the properties to the following:\n\n\n\nDuplicate the Emit On state and rename to \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmit Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Change the Channel message to \u00e2\u0080\u009clightOff\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nIn the State Graph, reposition the state nodes to the following by clicking and dragging:\n\n\n\nNow we need to add transitions between each state. Starting with the first Wait for Click action, click the transition label (i.e. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOn Click/Tap Entity) at the bottom of the state. Drag a transition arrow to the next state.\n\n\n\nDo that for all the states until the behavior cycle is completed.\n\nNote: Make sure the first Wait for Click state is set as the Initial State.\nTest your behavior! Press play and click on the switch. See it flip up and down. If you have the State Machine editor open, see the states transitioning.\nLight On/Off Behavior\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s create a behavior for the Point Light. This behavior will turn the light on and off. To have it occur on the click of the light, we will use the messages being emitted by our first behavior (\u00e2\u0080\u009clightOn\u00e2\u0080\u009d & \u00e2\u0080\u009clightOff\u00e2\u0080\u009d). We will start this new behavior by using a Listen action.\n\n\nSelect Point Light and add a State Machine. Add a new behavior and name it \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight On/Off Behavior\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nChange the name of State 1 to \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen for On\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Add an action. Search for and add a Listen action. In the Message channel add the \u00e2\u0080\u009clightOn\u00e2\u0080\u009d message.\n\n\n\nAdd another state. Rename it \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight On\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Add an action. Search for and add a Set Light Properties action. Make sure the Intensity is set to 1. Add a Transition action. Finally, click this state to be Set As Initial State. This will turn off the lights as soon as the scene begins.\n\n\n\nDuplicate the Listen for On state. Rename \u00e2\u0080\u009cListen for Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Change the Message channel to \u00e2\u0080\u009clightOff\u00e2\u0080\u009d.\n\n\n\nDuplicate the Light On state. Rename \u00e2\u0080\u009cLight Off\u00e2\u0080\u009d. Change the Intensity to 0. Click Set as Initial State (because we want the light to be off when we start the scene).\n\n\n\nFinally, starting with the Light Off state (our initial state), add transitions clockwise. Your behavior should look like this:\n\n\n\nPress play and click the Light switch to see your Point Light turn on and off!\nApply Behavior to Other Entities\nThe Light On/Off Behavior works with the Point Light. In this final step, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s apply the same behavior to another Light entity.\n\n\nSelect the Directional Light entity.\n\n\nAdd a State Machine component.\n\n\nIn the Assets panel, filter to only see Behaviors.\n\n\n\nDrag and drop the Light On/Off Behavior onto the Directional Light drop input in the State Machine component.\n\n\n\nTest your scene again to turn on/off both the Point and Directional light.\nNow publish and share your scene!\nAdditional and Optional Steps\nConsider the experimenting with following steps:\n\nAdding a Host for Instruction: Add a Host with a custom speech that provides instruction to click the light switch. See the Speech Component tutorial for more information.\nAdd a Skybox/Skysphere: Import a 360 image skybox from the Import Assets Library, and add it to the Environment component. See the Skybox/Skysphere tutorial for more information.\nPlay/Stop Sound Upon Click: Add a Sound component to the Room entity and add a song/audio file to your scene. In the Light On/Off Behavior, add Play Sound and Pause Sound actions to play/pause your audio file.\n\nRelated Tutorials\nNow that you understand more about lights and cameras, you should learn more about light placement and the relationship between lights and materials.

data with fully managed Ground Station as a Service\n\n\n\n\n  Get started with AWS Ground Station \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS Ground Station is a fully managed service that lets you control satellite communications, process data, and scale your operations without having to worry about building or managing your own ground station infrastructure.\u00a0Satellites are used for a wide variety of use cases, including weather forecasting, surface imaging, communications, and video broadcasts. Ground stations form the core of global satellite networks.\u00a0 With AWS Ground Station, you have direct access to AWS services and the AWS Global Infrastructure including a low-latency global fiber network. For example, you can use Amazon S3 to store the downloaded data, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for managing data ingestion from satellites, and Amazon SageMaker for building custom machine learning applications that apply to your data sets. You can save up to 80% on the cost of your ground station operations by paying only for the actual antenna time used, and relying on the global footprint of ground stations to download data when and where you need it. There are no long-term commitments, and you gain the ability to rapidly scale your satellite communications on-demand when your business needs it. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Introduction to AWS Ground Station \n         \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n How it works\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Benefits\n\n\n\n           Ground Station as a Service \n         \n\nAWS Ground Station provides a global network of ground stations in close proximity to our global network of AWS infrastructure regions. With AWS Ground Station, you no longer need to worry about buying, leasing, building, scaling or managing your own satellite ground stations. \n\n\n\n\n           Security you can trust \n         \n\nSecurity at AWS is the highest priority. As an AWS customer, you will benefit from facility and network architecture built to meet the requirements of the most security-sensitive organizations. AWS Ground Station provides premium data security and physical security without any additional costs. \u00a0\n\n\n\n\n           Pay-as-you-go \n         \n\nWith AWS Ground Station, you only pay for the actual antenna time you use. There are no long-term contracts, or hidden fees. With a single price, you can use any antenna in the global AWS Ground Station network. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n           Faster data downloads \n         \n\nWith multiple antennas at each of our geographically diverse AWS Ground Stations you can downlink your satellite data directly into an AWS region for immediate processing. Our Ground Station scheduling interface\u00a0allows you to get your data when you need it without scheduling delays or antenna conflicts. \n\n\n\n\n           Immediate data processing \n         \n\nAWS Ground Station provides satellite antennas in close proximity to AWS infrastructure regions, giving you low-latency and low-cost access to AWS services to store and process your data. This allows you to reduce data processing and analysis times for use cases like weather prediction or natural disaster imagery from hours to minutes or seconds. \n\n\n\n\n           Self-service scheduling \n         \n\nYou can easily schedule Contacts with your satellite using the AWS Management Console and APIs. Once reserved, Contacts can be rescheduled or cancelled up to 15 minutes prior to start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Building Blocks\n Global Network of Antennas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAWS Ground Station's global network of antennas lets you communicate with your satellite multiple times per orbit. You can downlink valuable satellite data to your AWS VPC within seconds of collection while commanding your satellites to execute the next mission. Earth Observation satellite operators can now refresh their archives with high-resolution imagery on a more regular basis to enhance monitoring and change detection applications that better support industries like forest monitoring and agriculture. \u00a0\n\n\n\n Cross Region Data Delivery \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCross Region Data Delivery lets you operate multiple simultaneous contacts using AWS Ground Station\u00e2\u0080\u0099s global antenna network from a single AWS Region. This means you pay only for the minutes of antenna access without incurring an additional charge for transferring data back and forth between regions to process. Using AWS's low-latency, high-bandwidth global fiber network you can collect real time weather data to evaluate changing climate patterns around the world. \n\n\n\n Real-Time Processing \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can begin processing your satellite data within seconds of reception at the antenna system. This enables you to turn raw data into processed information or analyzed knowledge within a matter of seconds. Today, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) operators are leveraging this capability to develop intelligence for first responders to use during active search, rescue, and recovery operations. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \u00e2\u0080\u009cWorking with AWS and leveraging the global coverage provided by AWS Ground Station, we are redefining what is possible in the satellite industry and reducing the cost and time required for organizations to benefit from satellite data. Combining Capella\u00e2\u0080\u0099s automated and real-time approach to collecting Earth observation data with AWS\u00e2\u0080\u0099s proven infrastructure and unparalleled portfolio of services helps our customers achieve timely insights that can save lives and protect the health of the planet.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\nPayam Banazadeh Chief Executive Officer, Capella Space\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more about AWS Ground Station\n\n Visit the features page\n\n\n\n\n            Ready to build? \n          \n Get started with AWS Ground Station\n\n            Have more questions? \n          \n Contact us\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Sign In to the Console \n\n Learn About AWS\n\nWhat Is AWS?\nWhat Is Cloud Computing?\nAWS Inclusion, Diversity & Equity\nWhat Is DevOps?\nWhat Is a Container?\nWhat Is a Data Lake?\nAWS Cloud Security\nWhat's New\nBlogs\nPress Releases\n\n\n\n Resources for AWS\n\nGetting Started\nTraining and Certification\nAWS Solutions Portfolio\nArchitecture Center\nProduct and Technical FAQs\nAnalyst Reports\nAWS Partner Network\n\n\n\n Developers on AWS\n\nDeveloper Center\nSDKs & Tools\n.NET on AWS\nPython on AWS\nJava on AWS\nPHP on AWS\nJavascript on AWS\n\n\n\n Help\n\nContact Us\nAWS Careers\nFile a Support Ticket\nKnowledge Center\nAWS Support Overview\nLegal\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Create an AWS Account \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n         Amazon is an Equal Opportunity Employer: \n         Minority / Women / Disability / Veteran / Gender Identity / Sexual Orientation / Age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLanguage\n\u00d8\u00b9\u00d8\u00b1\u00d8\u00a8\u00d9\u008a\nBahasa Indonesia\nDeutsch\nEnglish\nEspa\u00f1ol\nFran\u00e7ais\nItaliano\nPortugu\u00eas\nTi\u00e1\u00ba\u00bfng Vi\u00e1\u00bb\u0087t\nT\u00fcrk\u00e7e\n\u00ce\u00a1\u00d1\u0083\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00ba\u00d0\u00b8\u00d0\u00b9\n\u00e0\u00b9\u0084\u00e0\u00b8\u0097\u00e0\u00b8\u00a2\n\u00e6\u0097\u00a5\u00e6\u009c\u00ac\u00e8\u00aa\u009e\n\u00ed\u0095\u009c\u00ea\u00b5\u00ad\u00ec\u0096\u00b4\n\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 (\u00e7\u00ae\u0080\u00e4\u00bd\u0093)\n\u00e4\u00b8\u00ad\u00e6\u0096\u0087 (\u00e7\u00b9\u0081\u00e9\u00ab\u0094)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrivacy\n|\nSite Terms\n|\n Cookie Preferences \n|\n\u00a9 2021, Amazon Web Services, Inc. or its affiliates.

All requests made against\n                                                      these keys are logged as CloudTrail events.\n                                                   \n\n\nAWS managed customer master key \u00e2\u0080\u0093 AWS creates and\n                                                      controls the lifecycle and key policies for AWS\n                                                      managed CMKs, which are resources within a\n                                                      customer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s AWS account.

The alias can be used interchangeably\n                                             with key ID in many of the AWS KMS API operations.\n                                          \n\nPermissions\n\nA policy attached to a CMK that defines permissions on the key. The default policy\n                                             allows any principals that you define, as well as allowing the AWS account root user\n                                             to add IAM policies that reference the key.\n                                          \n\nGrants\n\nThe delegated permission to use a CMK when the intended IAM principals or duration\n                                             of usage\n                                             is not known at the outset and therefore cannot be added to\n                                             a key or IAM policy. One use of grants is to de\u00ef\u00ac\u0081ne\n                                             scoped-down permissions for how an AWS service can use a\n                                             CMK. The service may need to use your key to do asynchronous\n                                             work on your behalf on encrypted data in the absence of a\n                                             direct-signed API call from you.\n                                          \n\nData keys\n\nCryptographic keys generated on HSMs, protected by a CMK. AWS KMS allows\n                                             authorized entities to obtain data keys protected by a CMK.\n                                             They can be returned both as plaintext (unencrypted) data\n                                             keys and as encrypted data keys. Data keys can be symmetric\n                                             or asymmetric (with both the public and private portions\n                                             returned).\n                                          \n\nCiphertexts\n\nThe encrypted output of AWS KMS, sometimes referred to as customer ciphertext to eliminate\n                                             confusion. Ciphertext contains encrypted data with\n                                             additional information that identifies the CMK to use in the\n                                             decryption process. Encrypted data keys are one common\n                                             example of ciphertext produced when using a CMK, but any\n                                             data under 4 KB in size can be encrypted under a CMK to\n                                             produce a ciphertext.\n                                          \n\nEncryption context\n\nA key\u00e2\u0080\u0093value pair map of additional information that is associated with AWS KMS\u00e2\u0080\u0093protected\n                                             information. AWS KMS uses authenticated encryption to protect data keys. The encryption\n                                             context is incorporated into the AAD of the authenticated encryption in AWS KMS\u00e2\u0080\u0093encrypted\n                                             ciphertexts. This context information is optional and not returned when requesting\n                                             a key (or an encryption operation). But if used, this context value is required to\n                                             successfully complete a decryption operation. An intended use of the encryption context\n                                             is to provide additional authenticated information. This information can help you\n                                             enforce policies and be included in the AWS CloudTrail logs. For example, you could\n                                             use a key\u00e2\u0080\u0093value pair of {\"key name\":\"satellite uplink key\"} to name the data key. Subsequent use of the key\n                                             creates an AWS CloudTrail entry that includes \u00e2\u0080\u009ckey name\u00e2\u0080\u009d: \u00e2\u0080\u009csatellite uplink key.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n                                             This additional information can provide useful context to understand why a given master\n                                             key was used.\n                                          \n\nPublic key\n\nWhen using asymmetric ciphers (RSA or elliptic curve), the\n                                             public key is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cpublic component\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a public-private key\n                                             pair. The public key can be shared and distributed to\n                                             entities that need to encrypt data for the owner of the\n                                             public-private key pair. For digital signature operations,\n                                             the public key is used to verify the signature.\n                                          \n\nPrivate key\n\nWhen using asymmetric ciphers (RSA or elliptic curve), the private key is the \u00e2\u0080\u009cprivate\n                                             component\u00e2\u0080\u009d of a public-private key pair. The private key is\n                                             used to decrypt data or create digital signatures. Similar\n                                             to symmetric CMKs, private keys are encrypted in HSMs.\n                                             They are decrypted only into the short term memory of the\n                                             HSM and only for the time needed to process your\n                                             cryptographic request.\n                                          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Javascript is disabled or is unavailable in your\n                                                   browser.\nTo use the Amazon Web Services Documentation, Javascript must be\n                                                enabled.
